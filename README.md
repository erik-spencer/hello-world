My Name is Erik Spencer, I am a veteran of the US Army, where I found my love for electronics and programming
with being able to create and modify electronics to do what I want them to do. This lead me to leave the Army
and pursue a degree in Electrical Engineering, which I am in the process of. I enjoy going to school every
day and increasing my knowledge of electronics and programming. I hope to create some fun projects and put
them up here in the future for everyone to enjoy.
